To create a comprehensive `README.md` file for your **DSA Project**, I'll first take a look at the contents of your Jupyter Notebook (`DSA Project.ipynb`). Let me analyze the file and extract details like:

- Project objective  
- Algorithms/data structures used  
- Problem solved  
- How to run the notebook  
- Example outputs, etc.

Give me a moment to go through it.

Based on the notebook, your project focuses on predicting **Employee Attrition** using machine learning. It involves data preprocessing, EDA, and logistic regression modeling.

Here's a well-structured `README.md` you can use:

# DSA Project: Predicting Employee Attrition

This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition using a real-world HR dataset. It was developed as part of a Data Structures & Algorithms coursework.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze employee data and build a classification model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (`Attrition`).

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is **HR-Employee-Attrition.csv**, which includes various features like:

- Age
- Gender
- Department
- Job Role
- Business Travel
- Marital Status
- Overtime
- Education Field
- ...and more

Target variable: `Attrition` (Yes/No)

---

## 🧪 Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Import & Initial Exploration**
   - Loaded CSV file using Pandas
   - Previewed basic information and data types

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled categorical columns using `LabelEncoder`
   - Checked for missing values and imbalanced classes
   - Encoded target variable

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized class distribution (`Attrition`)
   - Examined age distribution and correlation between features

4. **Model Building**
   - Used **Logistic Regression** for classification
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy score and classification report

---

## 📊 Results

- Model trained using logistic regression
- Evaluation metrics used: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pwmbugua/Employee-Attrition..git
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment
   - Open `DSA Project.ipynb`

3. Install dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

4. Run all cells in sequence.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Use other models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or XGBoost
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Address class imbalance with SMOTE or under-sampling
- Deploy the model with a web interface
